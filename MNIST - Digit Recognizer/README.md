# Digit recognizer with MNIST dataset

- Convolutional neural network implementation of the basic MNIST digit recognizer problem
- Evaluated version of this Jupyter notebook is available at Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/zecklar/mnist)
- Accuracy ~ 99.5%
- No external datasets are used, only the one provided by Kaggle (it's easy to get the accuracy to 100% if the extended dataset of Keras is also used
