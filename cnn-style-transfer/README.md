# Convolutional style transfer network

- Based on the white paper by A. Gatys (Digit recognizer with MNIST dataset)

- Convolutiona neural network implemented with Keras
- Pass content and style image, run the network and as a result it gives you back combined image where the spatial features are copied from the content image and the overall style from the passed style image

## Demo

##### Inputs:
- Content image: Venice river view
- Style image: image of the painting "Rain pricess" by Leonid Afremov
- Last part is the combination of the two
